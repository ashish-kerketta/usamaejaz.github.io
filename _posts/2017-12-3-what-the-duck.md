Too many ducks? Let's replace them to make the web a better place for duck lovers.

It was a simple day when I was working on a browser extension. On twitter, I saw someone tweeting about the idea of seeing "duck" everywhere on the internet instead of the <abbr title="F***">_F word_</abbr>. YES, why not. That will be fun.

Seeing the internet full of ducks will be fun, I thought. I started building the browser extension for doing this. The extension will replace every instance of the _F word_ with duck. So now, you all can enjoy an internet full of ducks. 



## What The Duck

So, I created this cross-browser extension in some hours. There are similar extensions which remove or replace some words / content from the internet (examples: <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/make-america-kittens-agai/klchnmggepghlcolikgaekpibclpmgcm?hl=en" target="_blank">Make America Kittens Again</a> and <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/trump-filter/lhondapiaknegjpellpodegmeonigjic?hl=en">Trump Filter</a>). 

### Features

Simple extension, simple features. 
- Replace all instances of the _F word_
- You can exclude various sites
- Shows the count of ducks found on page

### Install

- [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/what-the-duck/akcgddilpnbanfbhndpkfcfaemahiacg)
- [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/addon/what-the-duck)
- [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/what-the-duck/)

_If you want to manually install the extension, the instructions are on [GitHub](https://github.com/usamaejaz/what-the-duck)._

### Open Sourced

The code is open-sourced at [github](https://github.com/usamaejaz/what-the-duck) ([https://github.com/usamaejaz/what-the-duck](https://github.com/usamaejaz/what-the-duck)).

_On a side-note, don't forget that you have actually installed an extension which is responsible for most of the "ducks" you see. I actually forgot myself and started thinking why everyone is using the word "duck" (it was in the comments section of an anime episode)._

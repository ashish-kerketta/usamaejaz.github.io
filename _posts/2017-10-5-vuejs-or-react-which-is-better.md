title: Vue.js or React, Which is Better?
---

Vue.js is often compared to other libraries like React, Angular, Knockout, Ember etc. If you are a React fan, chances are that you may not agree with me. This post may look biased. For detailed comparison, [click here](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/comparison.html).

## Why Vue.js

This may seem like a biased opinion. Those who are already using React and are happy enough to stick with it may prefer React. It's just what works for you. Your choice can be different and that's perfectly fine (as long as you have reasons for that choice). 

React has a very solid ecosystem. Vue.js is still growing but has managed to get enough community support. Vue.js is flexible, easier to learn and has the best of Angular and React.

Vue.js has flexible nature. You don't need to mix HTML with Javascript (JSX), you don't need to spend too much time learning it (if you are newly adopting it) as compared to React. You get the best of React and Angular. 

Vue.js also has mutable state and you don't need to call `setState()` again and again, it's all handled automatically by Vue.js. 

Vue.js is growing really fast and is topping React and Angular. As of writing this post, Vue.js has managed to go to the top with React and Angular being second and third on Google Trends.
